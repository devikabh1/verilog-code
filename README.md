AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a specification published by the American
National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2001, as FIPS 197.[1]
AES describes a symmetric-key algorithm, in which the same key is used for both
encrypting and decrypting the data. The block size is restricted to 128 bits. The key size
can be 128, 192, or 256 bits.


Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), is an approved cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The AES can be programmed in software or built with pure hardware.
